* Problem specification

  $$ f(x) = \frac{sin(x)}{ln(x)} $$

  $$ \int_{4}^{8} f(x) dx = \int_{4}^{8} \frac{sin(x)}{ln(x)} dx $$

  This integral cannot be solved analytically. On interval $[4,8]$ it is continuous, so we can apply numerical methods to estimate the integral.

* Strategy

  To approximate this integral I used the Simpson's rule. It can be derived from midpoint and trapezoidal rules.

  $$ M_1 = (b-a)f(\frac{a+b}{2}) $$

  $$ T_1 = \frac{1}{2}(b-a)(f(a) + f(b)) $$

  If we take weighted average of these then the leading error term vanishes.

  $$ S_n = \frac{2M_n+T_n}{3} $$
